PET BUDDY  Vet admin app Readme File
======================================

Python Project for Codeclan April 2022

For my first project at Code Clan I choose to do the Vet Management App

The brief was to build a web application that helps a veterinary practice manage their animals and vets: 
- The app should be able to register and track animals 
- A vet should be able to acces important data about a pet
- This includes owner details and being able to add treatment notes to the vet

Instructions to run this app

- Database: pet_data
- Flask
- Psql
- Python
- Jinja 
- Psycopg2
